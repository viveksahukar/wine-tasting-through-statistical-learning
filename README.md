Predicting the quality of the wine through its physiochemical properties

The open source datasets of red and white wine from Portugal were collected from May 2004 to February 2007. R has been used to do the statistical analysis enabling us to predict the quality and color from 11 physiochemical properties of the wine. Quality is an ordinal variable which ranges from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). Color is a categorical variable which has two levels: Red and White. All physiochemical properties are treated as continuous predictor variables. Initial exploratory data analysis has been done to get a better understanding of predictors and efficiently deal with multicollinearity and outliers. Regression techniques have been employed to predict the quality of the wine. Diagnostics have been done to check the consistency of the model. Interactions among predictors and transformations of the explanatory variables had been done to improve the plain vanilla model. An attempt has been made to use advanced machine learning models for increasing prediction accuracy in this classification problem. At last, the model choice has been suggested by comparing explanatory power vs. prediction accuracy.

The legend describing the files containing the R code has been included as a text file.

The powerpoint presentation detailing the methodology and results has been provided as a pdf file.

This analysis was submitted as a poster for final project in course "Modeling & Representation of Data" in December 2018, as part of Masters degree in Interdisciplinary Data Science at Duke University.
